review
"Thoroughly impressed with this airport. \n\nNot that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think..."
"Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.\n\nThe only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.\n\nThank goodness for the free WiFi..."
Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..
"This review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room. It is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions. The chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a Quran,bible, and Torah available. There are also prayer mats for Muslims, and an altar to kneel at. I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff. \nBeing Muslim I really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so. I used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around I was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use. Thank you CD airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship."
Great little airport. Now direct connection to Europe. Live piano music in terminal. Us airways hub. Rental car shuttles run every few minutes. Lots of charging stations for electronic devices. Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.
"It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of eateries, shopping and even a spa. \nThe only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane.  It's a HUGE airport.\nOn my layover on my way out I did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at Einstein Bros Bagels.  \nOn my way back I had 15 minutes to get to my plane.  I suppose I should have asked one of the carts for help."
"So honest moment I was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue. \n\nWhile we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there. By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nAnother really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch. If you're into history, aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flight...you'll want to visit here!"
"Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty."
"Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service, at least once you get past the fabulous sales people. My install was scheduled for between 9-11 am on a Saturday, dude called at 2:30 to say he was the \""outside guy\"" and was on his way. Was indignant when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a woman who knew nothing about my issues, tried to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a \""problem\"" with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable! Not thrilled with Time Warner or most of their contracted install/repair folks, but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule, they call! DON'T DO IT!"
"I made an appointment because I had an terrible, stabbing ear ache. After waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time, I was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything, I was given a hearing test. I never asked for it and don't know why it was done. Then after another long waiting period, the doctor finally saw me and he tells me I have hearing loss. He looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me I have no infection but rather TMJ which really, really scared me. I think he was wrong because two days later I had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared, no more pain. The entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didn't help me at all and took nearly three hours!"
"Be prepared to wait. We were told to be here at 11:15 for an 11:40 appointment. Coming up on an hour wait, ugh!\nAfter waiting over an hour to see the doctor, and to only talk to him for 5 minutes, was very disappointing.  The appointment was for my Mother who was previously told she could undergo a specific eye surgery and then upon arriving and pre-op review, she was not qualified. Not only was the experience in this office disappointing, it was a disappointing day for my Mother after expectations were expected."
"Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper! \n\nPlace - two stories and for the most part, clean.\n\nPrice - it's Mickey D's. \n\nService - somewhat quick in the drive-thru, friendly people. They only forgot once, but it's forgivable."
"RUDE RUDE RUDE. I normally NEVER leave a review of a fast food chain, but this is an exception.  The workers are just plain rude.  The fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale.  Avoid this place unless you just don't give a crap about how your treated and want a sub par Big Mac."
"I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.\n\nBut with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /"
"Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\n\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!"
"Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries. \n\nI came by here on a Thursday night, and they hosted a trivia night! It was fun!! Sadly, with my new work schedule, I have not had an opportunity to come back on any Thursdays."
"Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today."
"Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club."
What a fun place to get ideas for your house! They have over 100 booths from different vendors selling everything from jewelry to furniture. We spent a few hours here and bought a few unique treats!
"Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service."
"After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive \""comfort food\""."
"I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you."
"Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back."
Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!
The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
"While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."
"Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better."
"An associate of mine brought me lunch. TOGO and it was delicious. We tried the Spicy Chicken that was very flavorful and not burning your lips off. I tried their lo mein, which was delicious with varitey of meats. Finally I had the beef and broccoli with had a ginger/ orange sauce. Very tasty the beef was well cooked and medium, not tough. JUST ALL AROUND DELICIOUS."
"This is my new favorite HT. It's almost always crowded, but it's worth it!\n\nThe selection is better than most HTs, and the prices are even better. How the price can be different one HT 3 miles away from another HT is beyond me, but I've definitely noticed. \n\nOther differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others, and everything looks bright and clean. Who doesn't love shiny??\n\nThe HT in Matthews has a better local produce selection, but higher prices on everything else.  You can't win them all, I suppose."
"Eh, went here on Christmas for dinner. Had to first seating at 5. Order the special the prime rib, 5 minutes later oh we just sold out of that! great ordered the filet and it was just ok. Wine was outrageously overpriced. Amazing this place gets such great reviews. Oh and im OG palm one goer. The lobbies would have been a better call."
"Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!  \n\nI love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....  \n\nThe app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.  \n\nService is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!\n\nThis location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!\n  :-D"
"I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering \""discount\"" for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere."
"I went to OPH for dinner and decided on the eggs, bacon and pancakes. The pancakes and bacon were pretty good. The eggs I ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me. Two things stood out to me about the service. I was drinking coffee and the waitress asked if I wanted my coffee topped off with 'decaf' - I wasn't drinking decaf. Also, when I asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty (used) syrup from the neighboring table.... yuck!"
"We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown."
"I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because \""the computer won't let us,\"" we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food."
"The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets."
My family and I have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy...
"everything was sold out when i needed to be in Charlotte and so I tried this location mainly because it was available for my dates. I was worried that it wouldn't be nice, but i was pleasantly surprised! \n\nThe room was clean, well decorated and had a bedroom and separate living room with its own tv, it also had a small well equipped  kitchen (I didnt use it) but it had pots, pans, 2 burners, a full size refrigerator and sinks etc. \n\nThey didn't have a yucky comforter, but a nice duvet too and plenty of pillows, which I insist on! :)\n\nThey had a good desk with free internet and the comminity areas were nice, inside they had breakfast (which i was always too late for - ends at 9am) but looked nice and they also have a bar that stays open late in that same spot - outside is a common area with a fire pit and lots of seating.\n\nThey have a little store with most essentials in the lobby 24 hours too. I had a terrible Dr. Pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs.. thank goodness! I also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to Starbucks and I accidentally said RIGHT in front of the desk clerk - \n\n\""Oh! then i won't drink this crappy coffee... \"" \n\nI felt so bad as soon as I said it.. i am sure it is not crappy! \n\nI would stay here again, it was comfortable and affordable. The parking is kinda weird, but over all I was very impressed."
Awesome church full of the spirit of God!
"Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)"
"Glad we tried this at restaurant week prices.  Didn't realize it was  a \""corporate\"" place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of.  We had just said the food was decent but soulless, like you'd expect of a corporate restaurant when that bag arrived to our \""oh, that explains it.\""\nTypical South side snob crap.  High prices and low quality and originality  for people who want to be seen and spend alot and have the palettes of a 6 year old.  For more of the same you can buy $25 olive oil that's really canola at  Dean and Deluca next door.  \nLike the reviewer here  with one unsalted and one over salted selection, I will add that the duck was under cooked and the salmon over cooked.\nDISAPPOINTING"
"Phew, where to start with this place!!!!!!????  \nThis review is from a 1 time dinner experience on a Saturday. \n\nThe ambience is excellent.  Comfortable seating, spacious, and beautifully decorated.  Fun crowd that is business casual. \n\nOur service was excellent.  Really personable, made some solid recommendations and just really pleasant.  \n\nThe food was INCREDIBLE.  Let me spare your time and tell you that if you a very fresh tasting seafood dish whether it be sushi or oysters...go here.  Presentation is great, portion size is nice, flavors outstanding.  \n\nOverall, one of my best meals ever."
More like Downstream. In town from CA and wanted to try something new. Bad decision. Bad service. Food was bland & ill prepared. What a disappointment.
"I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...\n\nWe ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \""slightly undercooked\"" and he was \""trained that most food was sushi grade.\"" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good. \n\nLastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.\n\nPrices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts."
"Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.\n\nI have not met anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the \""SoPark\"" area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter."
"Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea, five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!\n\nFrom there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped, still good!\n\nI'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress, I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!\n\nPersian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio, Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!\n\nBaklava a bit disappointing, papery filo, though drier than the overly syrupy version"
A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
"\""The little hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there."
We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.
...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.
